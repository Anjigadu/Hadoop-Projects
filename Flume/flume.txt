# A Flume is the simplest unit of flume
# A Flume can connect any number of sources to any number of data stores 
# A Flume agent represents 1 hop for the data; if multiple hops using a chain of Flume agents
# Every flume agent has 3 compoents: receive data(source) /buffer data(channel) /write data(sink)
# (1)Source: receives data and pushes it to the channel
             listens to the specified source and understands the format in which data is sent
# Flume support many types of sources:
# (1)Spooling directory: a directory to which files are written by an application    
# (2)syslog: log messages written in the syslog format
# (3)exec: standard output from any command
# (4)custom sources: write your own sources which can receive and understand the format of data produced by your application
# 1 Flume can have multiple source components

# The channel is a buffer where data stays until the Sink writes it out to an endpoint
# The buffer capacity can be configured by the user
# It is important to configure the channel capacity as per the rates of the source and sink
# If the channels
