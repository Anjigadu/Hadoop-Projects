workflow
- define actions in a DAG(Direct Acyclic Graph) for the data pipeline
- actions program run (program: hive,pig,mapreduce,java, email, ssh, spark)

coordinator
- oozie structure for schedule execution of workflow 
- time trigger
- data trigger

bundles
- coordination of coordinators

oozie
- written in xml
- Oozie is a server-based workflow engine specialized in running workflow jobs with actions that run Hadoop, MapReduce,
  Pig, Hive, Sqoop,Filesystem and shell jobs.
- Oozie is a java web-application that runs in a Java Servlet-container.
- For the purpose of Oozie, a workflow is a collection of actions(ie. Hadoop MapReduce Jobs, Pig Jobs) arranged in
  a control dependency DAG(Direct Acyclic Graph).
  "Control dependency" from one action to another means that the second action can not run 
  until the first action has completed.
