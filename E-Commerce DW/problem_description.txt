The entire goal of investing in a data infrastructure is to improve the edge of business as well as the company's bottom line.

In this hackerday, we are going to be designing a data warehouse for a retail shop. 
The design and implementation, however, we focus on answering some specific questions that are related to price optimization 
and inventory allocation. 

The two question we will be looking to answer in this project include:
1. Were the higher priced items selling in certain markets?
2. should inventory be re-allocated or price optimized based upon geography?

We will recognize the entire purpose of answer these questions with data is to boost overall bottom line for the business 
while improving the experience for the shoppers

## Client faced pressure to migrate to faster processing cycles so that pricing team could answer more difficult questions 
about consumers and markets in smaller time frames. Historically, client's retail inventory, pricing and POS data was spread accross multiple systems and multiple formats. Business user needed to aggregate this information to understand inventory and pricing points across all stores.Specific questions that needed to be answered: "Were higher priced items selling in certain market? " and "should inventory be re-allocated or price be optimized based upon geography?"

We built a Hadoop infrastructure and migrated all required data into a centralized HDFS data hub repository from legacy database. Mapreduce code was developed to process daily data files and extract for presentation through client designed pricing portal.

File preparation that required over-night processing now completes in minutes each day, enabling pricing team to deliver dynamic pricing analytics that quickly react to changing market conditions.
