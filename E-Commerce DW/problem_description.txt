The entire goal of investing in a data infrastructure is to improve the edge of business as well as the company's bottom line.

In this hackerday, we are going to be designing a data warehouse for a retail shop. 
The design and implementation, however, we focus on answering some specific questions that are related to price optimization 
and inventory allocation. The two question we will be looking to answer in this project include:

Were the higher priced items selling in certain markets?
should inventory be re-allocated or price optimized based upon geography?

We will recognize the entire purpose of answer these questions with data is to boost overall bottom line for the business 
while improving the experience for the shoppers
