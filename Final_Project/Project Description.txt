# Build Job Portal Service using Twitter Feed Analysis
We will be loading live twitter feeds related to jobs advertisements. 
We will setup batch processing of tweets on hdfs and then extract the data to MySQL database. 
We will also use Oozie as workflow manager.

flume -> load tweets from twitter 
pig -> process the tweet to project feature
Impala/hive -> quering and analysis on hdfs / data warehouse for structured data
Sqoop -> move data to mysql database 
Oozie -> workflow/ to coordinate pig and hive work
