## Data Type
#1. Primitive 

#2. Complex

(1) Array: Contain a list of elements of the same data type. These elements are accessed by using an index. 
            For example an array, “fruits”, containing a list of elements [‘apple’, ’mango’, ‘orange’], 
            the element “apple” in the array can be accessed by specifying fruits[1]

(2) Map: Contains key, value pairs. The elements are accessed by using the keys. 
         For example a map, “pass_list” containing the “user name” as key and “password” as value, 
         the password of the user can be accessed by specifying pass_list[‘username’]

(3) Struct: Contains elements of different data types. The elements can be accessed by using the dot notation. 
             For example in a struct, ”car”, the color of the car can be retrieved as specifying car.color
