Data Sets:
1. TheNBERU.S.PatentData:
Data Link http://www.nber.org/patents/
We will use two of the data sets :
a) Patentdata,includingconstructedvariables:
Data link http://www.nber.org/patents/pat63_99.zip
Summary of this data is given here http://www.nber.org/patents/pat63_99.txt.
b) Class codes with corresponding class names:
Data Link http://www.nber.org/patents/list_of_classes.txt
Summary of data: This data need to be cleaned in a way so that it only contains class Id and title in tab seperated form. Just remove first 9 lines.
Problem:
For this problem we have divided data for patents into multiple files, one file containing
patents granted in one particular year. Do following in hive:
1. Create an external table for Patent data set so that it can be used efficiently for queries which require looking into patents granted for given year.
2. Find out number of patents granted in year 1963.
3. Find out number of patents granted in each country in year 1999.
