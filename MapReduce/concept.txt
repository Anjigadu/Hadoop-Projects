## How MapReduce works: Mapping
# Step 1. The MAPPER converts raw source data into key/value pairs
def Mapper(self,key,line):
    (userid,rating,)=line.split('\t')
    yield rating,1
# Step 2. Sort and Group
# Step 3. Reducer
def Reducer(self,rating,occurences):
        yield rating,sum(occurences)
