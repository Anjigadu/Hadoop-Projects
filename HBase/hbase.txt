# HBase built on top of hadoop.
# GOOGLE 3 Seminal Paper:
# (1) GFS (GOOGLE File System): storage (HDFS)
# (2) MapReduce: processing data (Hadoop MapReduce)
# (3) BigTable: database management (HBase)

# HDFS:
# name node (master node): manages overall file systems
# (1)the directory structure  (2)metadata for all the files
# data nodes: the data is physically stored on these nodes
# To define a replication factor in HDFS
# Each block is replicated and the replicas are stored in different data nodes

# MapReduce:
# 2 phases -> (1) Process each block in the node it is stored in (Map phase)
              (2) Take all the results to one node and combine them (Reduce phase)
